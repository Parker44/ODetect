# ODetect

This project is a subcomponent of the ODetect platform which is intended to detect opioid overdoses by monitoring breathing rate which is extracted from the user's heart beat.

The folder "MAX30102_Bluetooth" contains the microcontroller code which is a modified version of the "heartratemonitor" example sketch provided by the Adafruit BluefruitLE library.
