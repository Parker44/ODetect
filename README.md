# ODetect
These Arduino and Processing scripts are related to the development of a PPG heart beat sensor. The MAX30102_data_collection folder contains the firmware that is uploaded to the Adafruit microcontroller which employs a reflectance-based IR sensor (MAX30102) to determine the skin absorbance of the user.

This project is a subcomponent of the ODetect platform which is intended to detect opioid overdoses by monitoring breathing rate which is extracted from the user's heart beat.
